# Radio PRO 2.8.5

Thank you for buying our asset "Radio PRO"! 
If you have any questions about this asset, send us an email at [radio@crosstales.com](mailto:radio@crosstales.com). 
Please don't forget to rate it or even better write a little review – it would be very much appreciated.



## Description
Have you ever wanted to implement radio stations but don't want (or can't) pay an horrendous amount of money?
Whenever you like to provide good sound from famous artists for your games or apps, tune in on one of the 
uncountable Internet MP3 and OGG radio stations available for free.

Thanks to this asset, it is now possible for all Unity developers to listen to high quality sound 
without additional charges.
Alternatively receive music streams from your own server (e.g. Icecast, VLC Server etc.). 

We also implemented a unique sound visualizer in the demo scene, which you can modify to your liking.

Please read the "Radio-doc.pdf" and "Radio-api.pdf" for more details.



## Upgrade to new version
Follow this steps to upgrade your version of "Radio PRO":

1. Update "Radio PRO" to the latest version from the "Unity AssetStore"
2. Inside your project in Unity, go to menu "File" => "New Scene"
3. Delete the "Assets/crosstales/Radio" folder from the Project-view
4. Import the latest version from the "Unity AssetStore"



## General note
We included the various stations in the demo scenes mainly to show that it works technically and 
also for fun (we like music and it was interesting to find all these different radio stations).
If you plan on including stations in a game that you release on a commercial basis, 
we strongly recommend that you contact the stations you want to use yourself.
